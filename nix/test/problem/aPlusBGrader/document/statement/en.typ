  *This is a grader interaction problem.*

  You are given two integers $A$ and $B$. Your task is to calculate the sum of these two integers.

  You must include the header file `add.h` in your source code.

  You are required to implement the following function:

  ```c
  int32_t add(int32_t a, int32_t b);
  ```

  This function takes two 32-bit integers, `a` and `b`, and must return their sum.
