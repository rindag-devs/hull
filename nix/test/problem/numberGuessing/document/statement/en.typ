  *This is a standard I/O interaction problem.*

  Given an integer $n$ ($1 <= n <= 10^9$), the interaction library will select an integer $m$ in $[1,n]$, and you should write a program to guess it.

  You can perform two operations:

  `Q x`: ask whether the integer $x$ is greater than, less than, or equal to $m$. The interaction library returns a character indicating the answer: `>` if $x>m$, `=` if $x=m$, `<` if $x<m$. This operation cannot be called more than $50$ times.

  `A x`: report that the value of $m$ is $x$, this operation has no return value, and the program must exit immediately after executing this operation.
